# 📘 Manual Testing – Project Gutenberg Homepage

## 📖 Overview
This section of the repository contains all **manual testing artifacts** for the Project Gutenberg homepage.  
It demonstrates the QA lifecycle from requirements → planning → test case design → execution → closure.

---

## 📂 Contents
- **SRS.md** – Software Requirement Specification defining scope, functional & non-functional requirements.
- **TestPlan.md** – Strategy document outlining scope of testing, approach, entry/exit criteria, deliverables, risks.
- **TestCases.xlsx** – Detailed manual test cases (positive, negative, boundary scenarios).
- **TestSummaryReport.md** – Execution summary with pass/fail counts, defects, and lessons learned.
- **BugReportTemplate.md** – Standard template for logging defects.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Validate homepage functionality (search bar, navigation buttons, donate button, book image redirections).
- Ensure usability and redirection accuracy.
- Provide traceability between requirements and test cases.
- Document execution results and closure activities.

---

## 🛠️ Process Flow
1. **Requirement Analysis** → SRS.md, RTM (implicit in test cases).
2. **Test Planning** → TestPlan.md.
3. **Test Case Design** → TestCases.xlsx.
4. **Test Execution** → Results logged in TestSummaryReport.md.
5. **Defect Reporting** → BugReportTemplate.md.

---

## ✅ How to Use
- Start with **SRS.md** to understand requirements.  
- Review **TestPlan.md** for testing strategy.  
- Explore **TestCases.xlsx** for detailed manual cases.  
- Execute cases and log results in **TestSummaryReport.md**.  
- Use **BugReportTemplate.md** to document defects.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- Manual testing focuses on **functional validation**.  
- External site content (social media, book text) is **out of scope**.  
- Automation testing is documented separately in the `Automation_Testing` folder.
